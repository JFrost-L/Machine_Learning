# Machine Learning Practical Exercises Repository

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebook exercises focused on Machine Learning concepts and applications, all developed and executed in **Google Colab**. These exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience with various Machine Learning techniques using Python and popular libraries.

## Key Features

- **Google Colab Compatibility**: All notebooks are designed to run seamlessly in Google Colab, without the need for local setup. Simply open the notebooks and start executing code in a cloud environment.
- **Interactive Learning**: Each notebook is structured to provide a step-by-step walkthrough of machine learning concepts, accompanied by code snippets and visualizations.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: The notebooks cover a wide range of topics such as data preprocessing, supervised learning (e.g., regression, classification), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction), and model evaluation techniques.
- **Real-world Datasets**: Exercises make use of real-world datasets to demonstrate practical applications of machine learning algorithms.
- **Modular Design**: Each notebook is self-contained, focusing on a specific concept, which allows for flexible learning at your own pace.

## How to Use

To get started with these notebooks on Google Colab:

1. Click on the notebook link provided in the repository.
2. Once the notebook opens in Colab, click on **"Open in Colab"** if necessary.
3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Use the following command to install any missing libraries in Colab:
   ```python
   !pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
